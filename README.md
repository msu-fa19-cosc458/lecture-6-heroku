# Heroku Example

## Procfile
Procfile is a file used to tell heroku how to run your app. Just like AWS, you can only run one app at a time. For the project, you can only run from one app which means you need to either
1. Paste all your code in one file (which I strongly advise to not do as it can get messy)
2. Create classes for each of your APIs and pull them in via import.
